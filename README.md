# Work Day Scheduler

In this project I refactered the base code to add functionality using Javascript. When the user presses the save button, their input in the textarea is saved locally. The schedular compares the current time to each correspding time-block, and adds the class carrying the color attribute to represent past, present, and future events. The saved inputs are brought back into the correct time-block textarea when refreshed.
